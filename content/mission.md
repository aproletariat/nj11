NJ11 for Palestine is an 501(c)(4) independent organization committed to advocating for enduring change for the Palestinian people within New Jersey's 11th Congressional District. By highlighting the significant challenges faced by Palestinians, including systemic injustices, occupation-related hardships, and the denial of fundamental human rights, we aim to foster a community that is both engaged and informed. Our mission extends beyond mere advocacy; we seek to empower our community to influence political representation, ensuring it is not only transparent and responsive but also accountable. We champion the values of fairness, compassion, inclusivity, and a decent quality of life, focusing on making a substantial impact in our district and advocating for the dignity and rights of the Palestinian people.
